50 x TAE stock for agarose gels

 

242g Tris base

57ml glacial acetic acid

100ml of 0.5M EDTA (pH8)*

Bring up to 1L with dH2O

 

 

* 0.5M EDTA (MW 372.24g)

 

18.61g in 50ml dH2O

Mix – will be very cloudy

Check pH and adjust to pH8 with NaOH to
make it dissolve

I used 10% NaOH and needed > 20ml to
adjust to pH 8 so maybe make some 50/100% NaOH so volume not messed up and then
you can add more than 50ml H2O at first step.
